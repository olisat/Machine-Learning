Write a Python program for the logistic discrimination gradient
descent algorithm with L2-norm regularization. The error function to minimize is as follows:
   E = sum_{i=1}^n [- r_i log(sigmoid(w^T x_i + w0)) - (1- r_i) log(1-sigmoid(w^T x_i + w0)) ] + (lambda/2) sum_{j=1}^m w_j^2 where w^T = (w_1,w_2,...w_m)
   
The modified gradient for regularization is computed as follows:
   del_E/ del_w_j = - sum_{i=1}^n  [ x_{ij} (r_i - sigmoid(w^T x_i + w0)) ] + lambda * w_j  for j = 1,2,...m
   del_E/ del_w_0 = - sum_{i=1}^n  (r_i - sigmoid(w^T x_i + w0)) 
Note that you should update w_j by eta * (- del_E/ del_w_j) in each step.
   
The input should be the same as for Least squares. Do not convert 0 to negative labels. They must remain 0 for the logistic 
regression gradient descent.

There are 2 parts to this assignment.

In the first part, set lambda = 0 to predict labels for data not in the training set as you had done before in previous assignments.
You can test your data with the following input you had used previously.

0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
10 10
10 11
11 10
11 11

and labels

0 0
0 1
0 2
0 3
1 4
1 5
1 6
1 7


Use eta=.01 and stopping condition of .0000001. 

Your final w would be close to the one shown below. 

w = 0.957672135162093 0.956767618860693 
||w||=1.35371348333622
distance to origin = -6.83744723331703

You should also check your predictions for climate data with trainlabels.0 against the expected results posted in Moodle.

In the second part of the assignment, you will be dividing the training label data into 2 sets one for training i.e. for determining the model
parameters and the other for cross validation i.e. for predicting the labels. You should compute training error, cross-validation error, total error 
as well as number of misclassifications (training, cross-validation and total); note these errors will not include regularization terms. 
You should do this for lambda = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 5.0 
You need to repeat this when training set is 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 of the given label set. Determine which value of lambda gives mimimum error for each of these 
3 partitions for the climate data with trainlabels.0 file.
Submit the results of second part of assignment in a text file.
 
Submit your assignment by copying it into the directory
/afs/cad/courses/ccs/f18/cs/675/101/<ucid>.
For example if your ucid is abc12 then copy your solution into 
/afs/cad/courses/ccs/f18/cs/675/101/abc12.

Your completed script is due Nov 1 2018
